# EV.TV.Survival.Study
A study of vulture survival from satellite telemetry

Hypotheses:
  1) Adult survival > immature survival > juvenile survival
  2) mortality greatest post fledging and 1st migration
  3) mortality greater during migration than summer / winter ranges
  4) Wild survival > captive-reared survival
  5) non-migratory survival > migrant survival
  6) TV survival > EV survival (LC vs EN)
  7) EV Balkans subpopulation survival < Caucasus < W Europe (due to migration difficulty, building off our other EV migration flexibility paper)
  8) male survival == female survival
  
Also, test survival across range of latitudinal (and maybe longitudinal?) bands.
